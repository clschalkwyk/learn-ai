Hi. Looking for some advice on the order routing feature in Shopify plus. In the past this was never an issue but since the implementation of this feature it seems to be causing a lot of issues on our side. 

Example. We have branch A with 5 in stock and branch B with 1 in stock. If I order 6 items, the system should allocate them to the 2 branches for fulfillment & delivery but at the moment Shopify is allocating 6 to branch A. We have reverted to the default, changed different ordering of the feature as well. It seems they do not look at stock anymore with this. Even though itâ€™s limiting the splitting of the fulfillments, it should still pay attention to the stock levels at that location. 

Hope someone can advise if they experience the same. Thanks.
